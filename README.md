# BHP UI

BHP UI library. A customised Bootstrap deployment with three themes, along with
some extra components.

## Getting started: With NPM

If you are using `npm` or `yarn` in your project, run:

```
yarn add bhp-ui bootstrap
```

Then import the SASS file below in your project:

```
@import "node_modules/@bhp/ui/scss/index";
```
## Getting started: No NPM

Download the `css/index-dark.css` or `css/index-light.css` files and add them to your static site.
You need to add `class="light-theme"` or `class="dark-theme"` to the root `html` element of your project.
